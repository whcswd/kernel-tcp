    steps:
        - Boot the board successfuly.
        - There are four user LEDs on board user_led1, user_led2, user_led3 and user_led4.
        - To turn on specific LED, run "echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/<led_dir>/brightness"
        - To turn off specific LED, run "echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/<led_dir>/brightness"
        - Run "cat /sys/class/leds/<led_dir>/trigger" to show all the triggers available for a particular LED.
        - To assign a trigger to any LED, run "echo trigger_name > /sys/class/leds/<led_dir>/trigger"
        - example: to assign "heartbeat" trigger to user_led3, run "echo heartbeat > /sys/class/leds/user_led3/trigger"
        - To remove trigger for any LED, run "echo none > /sys/class/leds/<led_dir>/trigger"

    expected:
        - LEDs can be turned on and off.
        - Triggers can be assigned/removed to/from any LEDs.
