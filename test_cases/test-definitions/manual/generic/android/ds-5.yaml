run:
    steps:
        - "Install ARM DS-5 on host PC"
        - "Power on the board until it booted successfully"
        - "In serial console, run:
           # lsmod
           # ps | busybox grep gatord"
        - "Check the Ethernet or wireless connection, ensure the board can get IP address"
        - "On host PC, launch ARM DS-5 by run (Replace \"ds5_installation_path\" to yours):
           $ cd /ds5_installation_path/bin
           $ ./eclipse"
        - "After set up work space, then on eclipse main screen, from menu bar, click Window -> Show View -> Other"
        - "Then click DS-5 -> Streamline Data -> OK"
        - "Put the board IP address in \"Address\" filed, click \"Start Capture\""
        - "Let the data capture running for 10 seconds, then click \"Stop\""

    expected:
        - "\"gator\" should be shown in output of \"lsmod\""
        - "\"gatord\" should be shown in output of \"ps | busybox grep gatord\""
        - "After clicked \"Stop\", a statistics data graph should be shown"
