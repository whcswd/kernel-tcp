        - Setup the DHCP and TFTP Server on your host machine
          https://github.com/Linaro/documentation/blob/master/Reference-Platform/EECommon/DHCP-TFTP-Server-UEFI.md
        - Provision TFTP with latest CentOS/Debian installer
        - Create the Grub2 config file pointing to new installer build files
        - On target board make sure to select network boot
        - Reboot the target board

    expected:
        - Target board boots and starts downloading OS installer from TFTP
        - Installer should install given OS successfully, without kernel panic, crash, hang or any other serve error observed
        - After successful installation target board reboots
        - The OS should boot to Linux shell prompt
        - The Linux shell should not boot to initramfs shell or minimal shell
