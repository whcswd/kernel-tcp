    steps:
        - Flash the board and boot succesfully.
        - Make sure "curl" and "iftop" utilities are installed, and at least two interfaces are configured and connected to the board.
        - Run, "sudo su" to become root.
        - Run, "ifconfig" to check both interfaces (going to be used for this test) are connected and IP address is assigned.
        - Run the following two commands to make sure that rp_filter is set to 0.
        - "echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/rp_filter"
        - "echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/default/rp_filter"
        - Run, "sysctl -a |grep rp_filter" to check arp setting.
        - Run, "curl -O --interface interface-1-ip http://samplemedia.linaro.org/MPEG4/big_buck_bunny_1080p_MPEG4_MP3_25fps_7600K_short.AVI"
        - Run, "curl -O --interface interface-2-ip http://samplemedia.linaro.org/MPEG4/big_buck_bunny_1080p_MPEG4_MP3_25fps_7600K_short.AVI"
        - Use "iftop" to verify that Curl is using the correct interface to download file in both cases.

    expected:
        - File can be successfully downloaded with both interfaces.
        - The correct interface was used to download file.
