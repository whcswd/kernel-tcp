    steps:
        - Boot the board to console
        - Make sure at least one BT A2DP (speaker, headset) device is available in the radio range and in discoverable mode.
        - "$ sudo bluetoothctl -a"
        - "[bluetooth]# pairable on"
        - "[bluetooth]# scan on"
        - "[bluetooth]# connect <mac_id>"
        - "[bluetooth]# quit"
        - Use paplay to play .WAV file. Run
        - "$ pactl list"
        - If the active profile isn't A2DP, then set it or else skip.
        - "$ pactl set-card-profile 0 a2dp"
        - Play sound and should be able to hear on speaker.
        - "$ paplay -d bluez_sink.<mac_id> /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav"
        - Play .MP3/.OGG file via xmms. Start xmms2, add files to the default playlist and play.
        - "$ xmms2"
        - "xmms2> add file.mp3"
        - "xmms2> add file.ogg"
        - "xmms2> play"
        - Set volume via xmms2
        - "xmms2> server volume [0..100]"

    expected:
        - Scanning works and device MAC addresses are displayed
        - It is possible to connect to audio device
        - Playback works well with no bad sound artifacts
        - Setting volume works well
        - No kernel errors crashes occur
