    environment:
        - manual-test

run:
    steps:
        - Enter the root directory of the sdcard under test.
        - On android, run the following command to test write speed.
        - "# dd if=/dev/zero of=dd.img bs=1048576 count=2000"
        - On debian, flag conv=fsync is needed, which tells dd to write to disk.
        - "# dd if=/dev/zero of=dd.img bs=1048576 count=2000 conv=fsync"
        - Before read speed test, clear the memory cache to ensure that the file is actually read from drive.
        - "# sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"
        - Run dd read speed test.
        - "# dd if=dd.img of=/dev/null bs=1048576"
        - Remove dd.img.
        - "# rm dd.img"

    expected:
        - dd commands finish successfully
        - read/write speeds are printed to screen.
