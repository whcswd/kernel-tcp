run:
    steps:
        - Connect the device under test HDMI output cable to Monitor/TV.
        - Make sure Monitor/TV has display input from at least one other source too.
        - Boot the device under test to UI.
        - Switch input display from Monitor/TV to board and other input source.
        - Repeat the process few times.

    expected:
        - Switching HDMI input works well and doesn't trigger kernel/driver errors on device under test
        - Switching back to input from device under test works well and UI is displayed on the screen
