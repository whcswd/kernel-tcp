    steps:
        - Login in as root and plug in your USB storage device.
        - Run "demsg" to find the device ID. Take "sda1" for example.
        - Run the following command to mount the disk. Modify the disk format as needed.
        - On Linux, run  "mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/"
        - On Android, run "mount -t vfat /dev/block/sda1 /mnt/"
        - Copy a file to /mnt and then delete the file.
        - Execute "umount /mnt" to umount the device.

    expected:
        - Disk mount and umount tests are successful.
        - File copying is successful and the file can be deleted.
        - No crash is observed from serial console.
