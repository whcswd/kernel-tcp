This directory contains test lists to be used for vkms's DRM support.
The files are passed to igt_runner/piglit with the --test-list parameter
directly.

The test lists are contained in the IGT repository for several
reasons:

- The lists stay synchronized with the IGT codebase.
- Public availability. Kernel developers can see what tests are run,
  and can see what changes are done to the set, when, and why.
- Keep track of the features implemented by the vkms DRM driver.

=============
vkms.testlist
=============

This test list is meant as a general test suite for the vkms DRM driver,
gathering all must-pass tests for the driver.

As more features are implemented to the vkms DRM driver, the correspondent
tests should be added to this list.
