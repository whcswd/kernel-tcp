This directory contains some OpenCL compute files, and a script to be used
to produce a header file containing the binaries for the CL against
multiple platforms.

For instance, to generate compute square Kernel binaries for TGL and ADL
variants, use this:

    opencl/gen_opencl_kernel xe_compute_square opencl/compute_square_kernel.cl \
	   xe_compute_square_kernels.c build/opencl tgllp adl-s adl-p adl-n

    cp build/opencl/xe_compute_square_kernels.c lib/xe/

The opencl/gen_opencl_kernel requires the Intel compute runtime[1].

This is usually shipped with different names on different distributions.
The above command generate Kernels for both TGL and ADL platforms.
Modern packages for Ubuntu are provided at github, under releases
tag.

Please notice that the GPU platforms supported by Intel ICD tools depend
on its version. In order to know what's supported, you can run:

	$ ocloc compile --help 2>&1|grep -A1 'Target device.'
	  -device <device_type>         Target device.
                  <device_type> can be: bdw, skl, kbl, cfl, apl, bxt, glk, whl, aml, cml, icllp, lkf, ehl, jsl, tgllp, rkl, adl-s, adl-p, adl-n, dg1, acm-g10, ats-m150, dg2-g10, acm-g11, ats-m75, dg2-g11, acm-g12, dg2-g12, pvc-sdv, pvc, gen11, gen12lp, gen8, gen9, xe, xe-hp, xe-hpc, xe-hpg, version  or hexadecimal value with 0x prefix

The above results are for Intel ICD version 22.43.24558, which supports
both TGL and ADL platforms, plus other newer GPU models.
