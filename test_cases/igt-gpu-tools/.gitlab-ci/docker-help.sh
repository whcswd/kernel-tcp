This is a igt-gpu-tools container:
 - igt_runner is in the \$PATH. In order for the results to be available on the
   host system, the directory has to be made available inside, e.g.
     docker run -v results:/tmp/results igt-final igt_runner /tmp/results
 - The test lists are in /opt/igt/share/igt-gpu-tools/
 - The test binaries are in IGT_TEST_ROOT=$IGT_TEST_ROOT

In order for the graphic devices to be available inside the container, those
either need to be mapped with --device or the container needs to be run in
--privileged mode.

Environment:
  - PATH=$PATH
  - LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  - IGT_TEST_ROOT=$IGT_TEST_ROOT

Contents of /opt/igt/libexec/igt-gpu-tools: $TEST_LIST
